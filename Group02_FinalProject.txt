This project implements a ridesharing taxicab system.

Dated statement: 
”the fact that the work being submittedby you is your group work.”

Additional Comments:
Run the program on windows from the build/taxicab.exe file and all the source
fles are in the src directory.

The lines drawn on the map are the edges of the digraph. Taxis turn red when
they have reached the maximum number of passengers. Green circles represent
pickup queries, and orange circles represent dropoff queries.
